# Status log

Newest entries first. One entry per work session/stage; enough context to
pick up where things left off.

## 2026-07-18 — Stage 2: submodules + patch.sh (done)

- 13 submodules added under `third_party/` per
  [plans/02-submodules.md](plans/02-submodules.md); pins listed in
  architecture.md. shallow=true except libiconv (savannah can't serve
  sha-in-want fetches). Patrick reconfirmed cmus @ master mid-session.
- libiconv pinned at v1.18 as the plan explicitly says, though v1.19 is
  out — revisit at stage 4 when the port is written.
- `patch.sh` adapted from vncpatch for N submodules; `patch.sh check`
  wired into `:app:patchCheck` → `preBuild`. patches/ empty (.gitkeep).
- Verified: clean clone + `git submodule update --init` (88M), patch.sh
  no-op, dummy-patch roundtrip (regen → reset → check/gradle fail with
  hint → am reapply → regen identical modulo commit sha), assembleDebug.
- Regen quirk (inherent to vncpatch pattern): reapplying via `git am`
  rewrites the patch's first `From <sha>` line since committer/sha
  change; content is otherwise stable.

## 2026-07-18 — Stage 1: scaffolding (done)

- Overall plan written and approved → [plans/00-overview.md](plans/00-overview.md).
  Later amendments during review: NDK-native CMake build for everything (no
  autotools/configure), mpris.c used only as an example (never modified),
  smaller stages, + m4a (mp4v2) and iconv (libiconv port) in scope.
- Gradle 9.6.1 wrapper (bootstrapped from downloaded dist; no system
  gradle), AGP 9.3.0, `:app` skeleton: minSdk 34, compileSdk 36, Java 21,
  no androidx (`net.pgaskin.cmus.android`), stub MainActivity, placeholder
  adaptive icon.
- Verified: `./gradlew assembleDebug` clean build; installed + launched on
  device (wifi adb).
- Workflow reminders: stage plans committed as Patrick (Claude co-author);
  implementation commits authored as Claude unless significant direction
  from Patrick. Real device only (no emulator). Lib sources for reading go
  in `~/srctest/dl`.

## Next

Stage 3: native deps A — CMake tree building the upstream-CMake deps
(ogg, vorbis, opus, opusfile, flac, wavpack, faad2, mp4v2) as static
arm64 libs. Plan not yet written (`notes/plans/03-*.md`); needs Patrick's
approval before implementing.

Workflow note: each stage runs in a fresh session — read status.md,
architecture.md, the overview plan, and the current stage plan first.
